# Project structure


There is `index.html` file, which contains all the markup of the website. There, everything is divided into different sections and the CSS files of those sections are placed in `sectionsCSS` folder. The project includes Web Components, which can be found in `components` folder, with their respective CSS files. 

Responsive design was achieved mainly by using @media queries, although some additional JavaScript was needed to achieve final result. The JavaScript files for that purpose are placed inside `responsiveScripts` folder.

Global variables and styles are included in `global.css` file and font-face declarations are inside `font-faces` file, which contains declarations copied straight from the TBC x USAID page.

Finally `main.js` contains everything else that was left to do - not much.
